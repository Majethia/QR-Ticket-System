# Ticket System for events.
This project allows us to manage audience entries easily. A simple google form needs to be filled and they get thier ticket mailed to them.

On the day of the event they need to show that ticket to the volunteer with the scanner to confirm the entry.

Confirmation of the payment screenshots is done using OCR and one manuall sweep to make sure everyone who registered actually paid for the ticket.
